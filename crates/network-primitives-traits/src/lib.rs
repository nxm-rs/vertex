//! Traits and utilities for network primitives in the Ethereum Swarm P2P network.
//!
//! This crate provides the core traits and types needed for node addressing and
//! identification in the network. It defines the [`NodeAddress`] trait and related
//! functionality for managing node addresses across different network configurations.
